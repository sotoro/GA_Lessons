<section id = "introduction">
<h1>RP 101 w/ Chath 2021</h1>
<p id="version">
Version 01 - 2021-11-05
</p>
<p>Welcome to RP 101! This class is to provide knowledge or assist with confidence building by cluing you in regarding good RP etiquette, terminology and styling. This is of course a modified version of a script that has been taught for many years. To the original creator and ever teacher who has taught it, I thank you.</p>
<p>The information I will be presenting is subjective, but is geared towards working well with the expectations of the administration both of the GA and the various sims.</p>
</section>
<section id = "Charon_Chath_Specific">
<h2>A note for when I am teaching</h2>
<p>
My personal style of teaching is intended to be interactive. I have a script I will follow, but I accept questions at any time. There are no bad questions, but I may  defer a question to later if it is due to come up in the script. So just blurt it out
</p>
</section>
<section id= "Chapter_1_scope">
<h2>Chapter 1 - Scope of these rules</h2>
<p>
Very few of these are going to be hard 'rules' for the GA, but violating etiquette may get an individual banned at the sim level if their behavior is disruptive. Be aware though, that even if you fail to follow common etiquette catastrophically, you will always be given a chance to improve and learn before the word 'ban' even comes up. However, it is a good idea to listen when a sim admin speaks to you. If an admin reached out to you to help guide you, respond, listen, and don't resort to insults, name-calling, or other problematic acts.
</p>
<p>
So, there is room for variation and individual flavor, but if an Admin asks for you to adjust something, consider it a good idea; they are not known to overly control things.
</p>
</section>
<section id= "Chapter_2_Lexicon_1" class = "indented">
<h2>Chapter 2 - Lexicon Pt. 1</h2>
<p>As we shall be going over a few terms while setting up, let's begin with a glossary of terms you may come across in your early days that may not be immediately clear.</p>
<h3>GA - Great Alliance</h3>
<div>
<p>
Where you are. The GA is a group of sims who have agreed to share a common Lore and a common set of compatible expectations. There can still be some differences, but generally it allows you to move your character between sims with very little, if any, modification required to match the expectations in a new locale.
</p>
</div>
<h3>RP -	Roleplay -</h3>
<div>
<p>Roleplay is what the GA is all about. It can be said that roleplay is 'collaborative storytelling' and it's a good descriptor. Every character is both writer and actor.</p>
<p>	Often bound tightly to RPGs, Roleplay has a few differences: Roleplays can be more free form, much like improvisational comedy, a good rule of thumb is to 'yes and' one another. The ultimate goal is to build a story via authors collaborating. Roleplaying differs from playing in an RPG (a role playing game) in some significant ways.</p>
<p> RPGs may include RP, but there is generally supervision over every aspect of your characters behavior and backstory. This is especially true in video games where your every action is curated from a list of possibilities conceived by the developer.</p>
<p>	For an example, the famous RPG videogame 'Skyrim' starts the character off waking up in a cart then leads you through an introductory mission. Without modifying the game, there is no possibility to hop off the cart and try to escape into the dense forest nearby, or to hop a wall to escape the dragon rather than being escorted through a 'dungeon'</p>
<p>	Meanwhile, a tabletop RPG such as Dungeons and Dragons grants a more human 'judge' the option of curating the story and 'railroading' the player in any direction they want; we do have elements of this at times to ensure a cohesive universe, but it is done sparingly. There is no over-arching story you must join in on, and there is no 'quest' one must undertake.</p>
</div>
<h3>OOC - Out Of Character -</h3>
<div>
<p>Being out of character is the antithesis of roleplaying. When OOC, a person, even if visible within the area where an RP is happening, is not there for the purposes of roleplay. </p>
<p>	Even when OOC it is a good idea to dress appropriately, which we will discuss later. A person may make an OOC comment by encapsulating their words in double parenthese ((such as this)). In addition, most people consider IM (Instant Messages) to be OOC unless IC is agreed upon by both participants.</p>
<p>	If an RP scene is in process and you are OOC, it is a good idea to avoid interrupting the scene and simply read what is written; however, if you are in a scene and need clarification about a post, feel free to use a little OOC chatter to ensure your own post will be accurate. </p>
<p>In your early hours of the GA, it may be advisable to slip on an OOC 'titler' to let everyone know you are not 'present' while you read to get a feel for the kinds of RP that happen in a sim, and to gather ideas on how to do so well.</p>
</div>
<h3>IC -	In Character -</h3>
<div>
<p>Being IC means you are ready to Roleplay, an IC comment is one made within the context of your character, their knowledge, experiences and perceptions. IC comments need not reflect the opinions of your OOC self, so if you see someone make an IC comment that you OOCly disagree with, consider that any OOC outrage may be misplaced. This is especially true when dealing with villain characters who may be kind and helpful behind the scenes, despite being surly or provocative IC.</p>
</div>
<h3>Player Character - PC</h3>
<div>
<p>The player character is the character a person has chosen to portray. They are full members of the GA and can level up within the guilds and are considered 'permanent' fixtures in their home-land.</p>
</div>
<h3>IM -	Instant Message</h3>
<div>
<p>A term I used earlier refers to the user to user communications, excluding other bystanders or group members. In other scenarios an 'IM' may also be referred to as a 'DM' (Direct Messages) however, as the acronym 'DM' has an alternate meaning in the roleplay community, you may find it harder to 'slide into someone's DMs'. This alternate meaning will be discussed later.</p>
</div>
<h3>Admins -	Administrators</h3>
<div>
<p>These are individuals who have taken on an OOC role for the GA, essentially working to ensure everyone has a good time in the GA. They may primarily work behind the scenes, or they may be out on the sim Roleplaying with the rest of us.</p>
</div>
<h3>Meter</h3>
<div>
<p>A meter is a tool used in the GA to facilitate RP by infusing our activities with RPG elements such as a 'Health Value' that can be depleted during 'metered combat'. At the time of writing this we are using the Unity 'Maxim' Meter v 5.5.3 and will in all likelihood become outdated sooner rather than later. The latest version can alwats be found on the Unity Maxim sim:<br />
<a href ="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Maxim/191/63/40" title="Unity Maxim Sim">http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Maxim/191/63/40</a><br />
Some sims expect it to be worn even when not in combat, others are more flexible. The meter also includes an OOC titler. Use of the meter is covered with more detail in another class</p></div>
</section>
<section id= "Chapter_3_prepare">
<h2>Chapter 3 - Prepare</h2>
<p>
So let's get started with roleplaying! Not so fast. To start with, let us what we should do to required to prepare Ourselves to RP.
</p>
<p>
While there is no rule for how to begin getting involved, it may be a good diea to know the kinds of roleplay that happen on the sim and when the sim's population is going to be largest to give yourself the best option of finding some RP that you want to get invovled with.
</p>
<p>
Most people are quite friendly and will answer a question for you. Never be afraid to show that you are willing to learn. You will find that most people in the GA are quite helpful and forgiving of missteps. There may even be volunteers about who specifically seek out new players to help them get ready for RP.
</p>
<p>
As different sims have different factions and as gaining abilities is granted largely through the 'guild' system, picking a character type and roleplaying with it. Some options include:WarriorsRangersRoguesClericsDruidsShamanMages
Progression within these guild may most commonly be done through your 'home sim'.
</p>
<p>
Once we have found a place we want to call 'home' and read all the provided notecards to familiarize ourselves with the sim, we can begin creating a character that works well with our home sim, either as a protagonist or antagonist. Character creation is covered in more detail in another class.
</p>
<p>
In all likelihood you will have completed these steps before taking this class, but it is a foundation to build on for the next part of preperation.
</p>
<p>
Dress your avatar in medieval-fantasy themed clothes that make sense for your race and intended guild. You are given a lot of leeway on this as long as you can justify for your character, however, there are no time travellers. You cannot play 'back to the future' with your character to explain having advanced technologies.
</p>
<p>
Your avatar's intended appearance should roughly match your presented appearance. If you are a Drow, seek out some gray skin. If you're of an elf race, look for some ears, if you're a pixie, perhaps invest in a small avatar and some wings etc. You can freely join the OOC chat even before joining the GA proper and may perhaps look for some clothing advice there: <br />

Naturally the marketplace is another good place to check: <br />
<a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com" title= "Second Life Marketplace">https://marketplace.secondlife.com</a><br />
We also have a discord server that members can join and seek advice:<br />

</p>
<p>
While we're discussing groups: The Great Alliance RP group is a good group to join. Posts made to this group usually involve IC things such as copies of Roleplays that have happened.<br />
<a href="secondlife:///app/group/0428e268-6fe9-2f46-717a-b93d6bf795a1/about" title="Great Alliance Roleplay Group">secondlife:///app/group/0428e268-6fe9-2f46-717a-b93d6bf795a1/about</a><br />
There is a GA calendar that will contain some of the events planned.<br />

<p>
Once you have chosen a home-sim and created a character, it is a good idea to submit an application to formally join the sim of your choosing.
</p>
</section>
<section id= "Chapter_4_Lexicon_2" class = "indented">
<h2>Chapter 4 - Lexicon Pt 2.</h2>
<p>
Now that the preperations are out of the way, let us discuss how to actually begin roleplaying. First, a few more terms, quirks, and no-no's that may be valuable to know.
</p>
<h3>Emote</h3>
<div>
<p>
Emoting is done via /me in the Second life chat and allows you to narrate your characters actions from a third person point of view with more detail than can be converyed by speech alone. Each Emote should include at least one action for someone else to possibly respond to.</p>
</div>
<h3>Thought-Emote</h3>
<div>
<p>
Sometimes outright hated, but sometimes useful for conveying some Out of Character information, more on this later. A thought-emote is an emote that contains your characters thoughts, something the other RPers will not usually know.
</p>
</div>
<h3>Para-RP - Paragraph Roleplaying</h3>
<div>
<p>
Para RP involves writing more detailed posts. These posts may take a little longer but will include things such as non-verbal emotes to describe actions.
</p>
</div>
<h3>God-moding / God modding</h3>
<div>
<p>
There are two schools of thought regarding what this means, but the result is the same when looked at with broad strokes. A 'godly modification', as it is sometimes referred to, is a modification of the world or an action that defies reasonable belief. This includes modifying the actions of someone else. Generally speaking, the control you exert over the world around you ends at the tip of your nose. You cannot force an action on anyone else.
</p>
<p>
The other school of thought is that it relates to the videogame cheat commonly referred to as enabling 'God Mode', wherein your character can ignore certain rules of the reality in which they live, such as mortality or by simplifying an otherwise a difficult fight with abilities that seem 'god-like'.
</p>
<p>
Whichever description you subscribe to, the result is that it involves impacting yourself or someone else in ways that violate reasonable belief, or the autonomy of another player. More on this later.
</p>
</div>
<h3>Meta-Gaming</h3>
<div>
<p>
Meta gaming is the act of granting knowledge to your character that should not be available to them in character. This information is often used in topics of conversation or when making a choice.
</p>
</div>
<h3>Power-gaming</h3>
<div>
<p>
Power gaming is really a sub category of meta-gaming. It involves optimizing your character beyond what makes sense for them. For example: if you've frequently RP'd as a skeptic of the divine, but pick a divinity oriented guild for your character because it: confers special powers, works around a weakness, makes yourself more powerful, then you have made a decision based on Out of Character information to power yourself up. The intent here shares the same goal as...
</p>
</div>
<h3>Min/Maxing</h3>
<div>
<p>
Min maxing is less common in RP but is sometimes used when justifying a rediculously strong character trait. Min/Maxing is the act of minimizing unneeded 'stats' or 'abilities' in order to power up others. For example. If you are a warrior/barbarian you could roleplay as being unable to interact with magic at all, something you won't normally do anyway, doing so may be used to give the perception of a balanced character when in reality the weaknesses are so nuanced, while the strengths so broad that you have created an 'over-powered' (OP) character.
</p>
<p>
With the addition of the Unity Maxim meter, which includes stats, it is possible we will see more of this as people forgo their characters strength, dexterity, or wisdom stats for a specific stat that will help them the most. An example might be in forgoing your wisdom stat as it primarily impacts metered spellcasting, and doing so because you could still roleplay as being wise without it. Or a crafsman may forego dexterity because they don't use dexterity weapons despite being a crafter of fine items, something that should very much require an above-average dextrous hand.
</p>
</div>
<h3>Non-player Character - NPC</h3>
<div>
<p>
An NPC is considered a brief or semi-permanent character within the sim. They are often still controlled by players but do not level within guilds and do not 'grow' in the same way a Player Character might. It is generally better that they be infrequently played compared to your player character.
</p>
<p>
NPCs also encompass non-visual 'imaginary' characters, such as characters that only exist in an emote. They can also have a visual placeholder such as a scripted mesh object in a tavern.</p>
<p>
In addition, some NPCs are considered public, available for anyone to use, such as a barkeep. Almost anything goes for these so long as the post are in keeping with the NPC as a character. Other NPCs are private, such as a mage's familiar and should not be used in a post without permission.</p>
</div>
<h3>Post Order</h3>
<div>
<p>To keep things organized and to ensure that all players have an equal opportunity to interact with the scene, RP typically takes place in a round-robin style, nobody posting twice until everyone has posted, and then using the same order for the next round of posts.
</p>
<p>
Shotgun Posting -Shotgun posting describes a posting style of sending lots of small posts into the scene in a relatively short space of time, much like buckshot into a target. Each post has the potential to change the scene and will require edits to the posts from other people before they can address it. For this reason 'shotgun posting is generally frowned upon.
</p>
</div>
<h3>White Knighting</h3>
<div>
<p>
Not universally accepted as a point requiring note, white knighting involves coming to the rescue of someone who may not need/want it. The term is often used for internet 'nice guys' when interacting with women who they later feel 'owe them', but the same action can happen in RP, even though the intention is generally more wholesome.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes a fight is pre-destined through ooc discussion to go one way to enable more RP down the road or as a major plotpoint for one or more of the characters involved. Not all fighitng, in fact, most fighting is not done through meter combat, and thus a single fight scene can take hours to write while still only existing for seconds or minutes to our in-character perceptions. As such it gives an enormous amount of time to interfere in a very brief battle.
</p>
<p>
If you are not in the immediate viscinity of a conflict when it erupts, consider asking each participant if they mind you joining before you enter the scene, potentially derailing it. While it never hurts to ask permission, if no conflict RP is currently happening, it becomes less necessary to ask unless secret things are being discussed which would ICly not be shared with your character.
</p>
<p>
To caveat this: if you are already in the scene when a conflict erupts, or if you are ICly in the vicinity: for instance, drinking at the bar when a fight breaks out at one of the tables, it is reasonable you would be able to intervene.
</p>
</div>
<h3>Posting in</h3>
<div>
<p>
Like white knighing, this piece of etiquette is less universally expected, however it is good practice to avoid problems down the line. Once you have decided to join a scene, you will make your first post.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of whether you explicitely asked permission to join a scene in public or not, your character is not present until your first post in a scene. Even if you waited to see what was going on before joining, you do not know anything from before your first post.
</p>
<p>
The rationale of this is simply that until your first post, other people do not know how you entered the scene. Acknowledging you before your first post god-mods you into joining the scene in a way they do not have the ability to control. An example of such a problem would be if you say hello to a rogue before they get to emote that they're in disguise or sneaking into the scene. Because they cannot acknowledge you, players cannot ICly decide to altar their behavior based on your presence either. Which allows the potential for people to try and have their chatacter discover things they would not otherwise get.
</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id= "Chapter_5_How_to_rp">
<h2>Chapter 5 How to RP</h2>
<p>
While we have covered a lot of dos and don'ts, we still have not covered how to actually RP, but now with the pitfalls identified, we can ensure we do so in a fair way. We will cover this now.
</p>
<p>
Initiating an RP can be done in multiple ways: The simplest is to IM someone and ask them. They may say yes and give you some details about their character that you would ICly know, allowing you to poft first.
</p>
<p>
Another, more casual way is to 'happen accross' someone in public and offer them a greeting or some other action to see if they take the bait. Remember that they are not ICly there until they respond, so be prepared to have to substitute the player with an NPC if the character you greeted is actually sneaking, spying, or simply not really there.
</p>
<p>
/me offers a gentle incline of his head in greeting to an elf he recognizes as he otherwise passes by.
</p>
<p>
A very small post, more of a 'breadcrumb' to join the RP, but very easy to carry on without the recipient if the person has become AFK, does not really want to RP, or if it turns out they're being a sneak by simply substituting the player for a throw-away NPC
</p>
<p>
/me watches as Jessup, the Elf, returns the gesture before returning to his own business of manning the marketplace stall. With a nod, Chath continues on his way, leaving the elf to it, completely unaware of the rogue listening from behind the curtain of a nearby window.
</p>
<p>
Of course if there is only one other person present and they have decided not to RP, you can just end the RP rather than make another post that only benefits you.
</p>
<p>
To join an RP, wait for at least one round of posting. This will let you establish how everyone is behaving, giving you clues as to how to interact with them in your upcoming post. Optionally ask if you may join, especially if secrets or conflict are being roleplayed, be sure to ask everyone.
</p>
<p>
Once accepted, make your first post. You can address those present, recognizing them quickly if you already know them (since you waited and already know if they're sneaking, in disguise etc.) Remember that you have not heard anything or seen anything not immediately visible before joining.
</p>
<p>
If someone has joined the RP, you can catch them up on what has happened oocly with a partial thought-emote recounting briefly some of the events that have transpired so far in the scene. This lets the joiner know enough for the scene to make sense even if they do not know enough ICly to understand.
</p>
<p>
Remember to include an actual action so that your partner(s) have something to respond to, never fully thought-emote, and never use a thought emote to say something negative about anyone else. Some people hate all thought emotes, which is fair, for those that do, it is usually because their character has been insulted and deprived of a chance to respond by a poorly done thought emote, or because they were given nothing to respond to.
</p>
<p>
Some people dislike thought emotes as they share information to a character that said character wouldn't ICly know; However, As you should be keeping IC and OOC seperate anyway, and most Rp's end up posted revealing the entirety of the scene, I see no issue with sharing a brief bit of information about the scene in-scene. It certainly beats an immersion breaking series of OOC chatter asking and answering questions.
</p>
<p>
Whether you do or do not use them is up to you, use them wisely or not at all.
</p>
</section>
<section id= "Chapter_6_Tips_and_tricks">
<h2>Chapter 6 - Tips and Tricks</h2>
<p>
So you've joined a scene and may or may not have been brought up to speed on whats going on:
</p>
<p>
Think about how your character would respond to what they have seen, heard, and felt happening around them using only ICly available information.
</p>
<p>
Try not to derail the scene by drastically changing it, especially if the current scene has an important or dramatic tone to it. It is collaborative, not all about any single character.
</p>
<p>
Make a single post at a time - Be thorough, follow-up posting can drastically change what your partners need to respond to, possibly forcing them to start iver.
</p>
<p>
RP in third person - While common for a verbal RP or RPG to use first person to describe their actions, this makes less sense when your characters name is worn over your head and prefixes every post. /me will remove the colon and allow your emote to contain your name at the beginning of the text. This lends itself better to third person. In addition, remember that this is a collaborative story effort and no story has multiple characters describing their actions in first person at a time. As a result, speaking in first person can feel jarring.
</p>
<p>
Be thinking, and even typing out what your next post might be as others make their posts. In a group of just 3 people, if everyone takes 15 minutes to post, it means there is a 1/2 hour wait between any one person's two posts. Time can run out without much happening in these situations.
</p>
<p>
Preparing your post for sending later is called pre-posting and it can turn a 15 minute wait for your post into a four minute wait, if not even briefer. However, be prepared to make alterations up and until it is your turn to post as more actions add to the scene
</p>
<p>
Be sure to adhere to post order and make only a single post each time as much as is possible.
</p>
<p>
Avoid using modern words and abbreviations in your post, don't type things like 'LOL', 'ROFL', 'GTFO' etc. Don't substitute words such as 'you' for letters, or numbers such as 'U R L8'
</p>
<p>
Do keep OOC chatter to a minimum during a scene, but do feel free to use them to let the group know if you need to go AFK and that they may skip your turn rather than waiting.
</p>
<p>
Do keep OOC and IC seperate, what happens to your character is not happening to you. Becoming overly attached to your character is the primary reason behind most poor RP scenarios including god moding and meta gaming.
</p>
<p>
Along the same lines, don't be afraid to take your lumps. You are not your character, sometimes we all experience loss. And loss can be important to any story. As I'll discuss next.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to use spellings that add an accent to your words, but go easy. The same combination of letters may sound very different in different heads when not using a real word. It is quite possible for your message to become nonsensical, if your character has a thick accent consider adding your characters speech in parentheses after.
</p>
<p>
Much like when using an accent, when using words from an imaginary language, whether freely typed or from one of the 'RP translators which are best used sparingly', put the translation afterwards. Even if you want to exclude someone ICly, no one should feel excluded OOCly.
