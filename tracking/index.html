Introduction
=====================

The purpose of this class is primarily to convey information about tracking, but also show how to use it in roleplay. It is my hope that armed with this knowledge you'll be able to use tracking in a way that is both believable and rich.

If a question or comment pops into your head, raise your hand and I will make time to for you to speak.

I like to be honest with my sources. various pieces of this class are inspired by the works of others. I'll be using information from 'The art of tracking' by Louis Liebenberg (1990). It's a good read if you can get a copy, I highly recommend it. As well as identifying different ways to track, it talks about the importance of hunting and tracking in human evolution and society, including perhaps the origins of art and science, that is of course beyond the scope of this class.
I'll also be using information from http://www.sportalignment.com/en/running.html which I use later to talk about the different kinds of footfalls and how they may impact footprints.


Example
=====================

It's late spring, there's been a bit of wind lately. The ground is dry in the natural trail that you are walking, but you see a tuft of off-white soft fur caught on a thistle, greenery around the thistle has bent in a single direction.

Many animals shed their coats, but you have the color and texture of the fur. Though there has been wind, the greenery around the thistle is bent, so it was likely snagged directly from the creature as it brushed by, you know the animal must be at least that high. Since the fur has not been blown away too much, it must be recent. 

You're a ranger, you know these lands and the animals within them. You know what fur of that length, color, texture, shed during the spring and at least that high means. What you have here could be a gray wolf, they'll be molting at this time and their fluffy winter undercoat is often shed as an off-white. You also know from the bent greenery which way the creature went. 

Why did the wolf go this way? Well, trails are used by a lot of animals to get about quickly, they often lead somewhere interesting, like a water sources. Great places to hunt and drink. 

Are you hungry, thirsty or in need of furs? Might be worth following.
You've now got a great lead on where to go next to track this wolf. And you did so without even a footprint to go on.


Philosophy
====================

So let's jump now to the beginning. Firstly I'd like to talk about what tracking is. Not its definition, but the philosophy behind it. To do that I'd like to address a misconception about tracking. Tracking is not the art of simply reading information from the environment, though that is certainly a part of it. It is also about inferring information from the environment. 

What we literally had from our wolf example is some bent grass and a tuft of fur, but when combined with our knowledge, we inferred not just an action, but perhaps even a motive or two. 

We could follow the trail for some time and there'd be a decent chance we'd find more evidence bringing us closer to the wolf, or if they left the trail, perhaps another clump of fur and bent greenery.


Believability
===================

Believability is important, and perhaps especially so when dealing with tracking. We tend to gloss over things when in RP for the sake of brevity, even when para RPing. How often do you think about the stray hairs you may be shedding, even as a human? Your footprints, the greenery you pass by, stones in a path that may become squashed underfoot. Like a stone cast into a pond, each action leaves ripples. The tracker sees those ripples and determines where the stone struck.

Evidence for an action exists in the real world and it should in a fantasy setting too. Use them, but if you're tracking a player, be sure to reach out to your target to ensure you're being fair. Did they even come this way? Have they recently shaved their head? or have it tied back, reducing the number that break free? are they wearing new boots that might not be so well known to you, or more generic?

Work not just with the evidence, but the hindrances too, be creative, and most importantly, enjoy the story. 

If you are being tracked, be fair to the tracker too. You don't live on the world, you live in it, you're going to leave traces behind. If something doesn't seem reasonable, let them know, but be constructive, give them something they could use.

Can they track you with wolves, or hounds instead as you have a distinctive odor? Is your race rare in that location and will they leave any distinct traces behind? Do you have an injury that may cause you to limp, or perhaps stop to rest frequently, changing the pattern of your footprints?

Do you carry a lot of weapons and armor that weighs you down? Does your scabbard graze the ground on occasion? Were you hungry? thirsty? did you leave an empty bottle or remnants of food behind? 

And if not, maybe consider inventing something? Your goal too should be to create more RP, never to limit it. Even if it means you fail your mission as a result, remember that it is failures as well as successes that can drive character development.


Knowledge
====================

I may occasionally use the word 'spoor', this word is broad and essentially means 'sign' or 'evidence' when tracking. Spoor does not tell you directly what your quarry is doing, but it tells you what they did. It is up to you to determine what they may do next and to look for the next clue in that area... A bit like a treasure hunt.

To know what your quarry will do next, you must know your quarry. Any time you're tracking an unknown prey or you're tracking in an unknown location, it will put you at a big disadvantage. Use it, RP your personal limitations as much as your strengths. 

Now when I say 'know your quarry' that may not exclusively mean at the personal level. Your ranger will at least need to know a little about the type of being they are. If you get some free time, consider studying different animals and races. Consider the subjects need to eat, drink, sleep. Even hooded, when the sun hangs low in the sky, a Drow may be more likely to be blinded. Perhaps they would prefer a shady spot to wait for nightfall, or a higher sun. Discuss this with your quarry, they may not have thought of it at the time, but would relish the chance to make their character more 'real'. 

Know your tracking location. Often times you may need to resort to ruling out certain possibilities to arrive  at the right answer. Remember our wolf example? Given the information, it is possible we are dealing with a white Swedish moose. But the rangers know the flora and fauna of the land and our example ranger had never seen a white moose nearby. So they need not consider it a possibility.

Empathy is the ability to share and understand the feelings of another. When you can do that, you can better understand their needs and desires. If you understand their needs, you can track them better. Think like your prey for a minute when tracking.


Types of Tracking
====================

There are essentially 3 kinds of tracking and in order of increasing complexity they are:
Simple Tracking
Systemic Tracking
Speculative Tracking

The three kinds of tracking look for the same evidence, but they differ in the amount of evidence required, and the amount of knowledge required...

Simple tracking is simply moving along a consistent trail of clues, like following a series of footprints. No need to really think beyond the immediately visible.

Systemic tracking allows you to track between breaks in the clues, this is probably the most common one. Let us say you're following footprints and they stop abruptly as the ground is too solid. Well perhaps you carry on in that direction and pick the trail up later. You don't know that this is the correct answer, your quarry could have changed direction, but it's a good starting point when you lose the trail.

Speculative tracking requires the most knowledge of your prey and the location. The trail's lost, but it pointed towards a cave 100 feet ahead. Oh, but you know your target doesn't like confined spaces, and that cave is tiny, so they probably diverted and traveled around the bottom of the cliff. There's a spring in that direction and it's a blisteringly hot day. Perhaps you should check there, they may have stopped for a drink or to fill up a waterskin.

Each type built on the previous one by adding more inference, allowing you to track with less evidence, and likely quicker. 


Spoor - Footprints
===================

There's many kinds of spoor (evidence), the most obvious of which could be footprints. They're a very good source of information, but variety is the spice of roleplay, and there's plenty of occasions where they won't work. Dry stone terrain, for instance.

A footprint could tell you definitively what you're tracking if it's an animal, and it gives you a direction of travel. By contrast, a  tuft of an animal's shed winter coat dropped on the ground, may not provide directionality, requiring you to seek more evidence to decide which way it was heading. 

Each animal has distinct footprints, but they do not just relay direction and species, they also relay 'how' an animal was moving, larger gaits with more pressure on certain areas of the print may indicate a sprint. 

I don't want to talk about any specific animals as there's many possibilities and without pictures it's largely uninformative, in fact some of the earliest cave paintings are suspected of being a depiction of different animal prints. I will talk about humans, however, I expect we're all pretty familiar with human footprints. With humans there's two primary ways that we run, heel-strike or forefoot strike.

When heel striking, our raised foot contacts the ground heel first, the foot rolls forward, and we push off with the ball of our foot and toes. This is uncommon when running barefoot due to the extra strain the impact will have on the heel and ankle, but it is a common style for people who only run in footwear. The footprints will likely be deep and the heel will be quite prominent

By contrast, forefoot striking is not only more efficient and less damaging, but the footprint will also be different. The print will likely be a lot lighter on the heel than the ball and toes. When forefoot striking, the forefoot contacts the ground first, and the ankle lowers the heel in a controlled way before the foot lifts back off. Barefoot runners have a great tendency to run this way, though it is still better for shod runners to run this way too. You could perhaps deduce the athletic experiences of your quarry a little based on this.

Wild elves, wood elves, and other less formal peoples would probably be more used to running without footwear, so their footprints might look different from a high elf as a result. You may also be able to discover injuries or if the target is burdened.

So footprints can tell you a lot, not just the shape of the creatures foot

Any questions so far?
<wait for questions>


Terrain
======================

Let's talk about the different materials that we can leave footprints in. 

We talked about snow, and this is a good one, but we can be more specific, too little snow and there will be patches of un-snowed area. If the snow is too loose the edges may collapse in, hiding the detail of the footprint which might normally assist with directionality or the specifics of the creature we're following. Too much snow and you're no longer following footprints, you're following holes, which again may obfuscate the type of  creature you're following. Once the snow starts to thaw, the print will quickly be lost, especially in sunlight, first becoming enlarged before becoming unhelpful.

So consider the specifics of the terrain you find yourself in. Is the area muddy? how muddy? it can't be too wet, otherwise it will fade quickly. A muddy trail can perhaps be left by feet for a short distance once the target leaves the mud.

More desert-like locations can be good also. The softer, sandy ground will readily yield to impressions, however if it is too soft, the details will be lost. If following something specific, like a boot print or a particular animal, tracking may be more difficult, in addition, the weather can quickly erase those marks. As these locations tend to have less plant life and less animal life, you may encounter less overlap with other creatures that may confuse the trail.

If there's a lot of foliage in the area, simple tracking will be made much more difficult, and you may not be able to rely on footprints to track at all, I will discuss alternative signs a little later.

Any questions or additions of probable good terrains to track in?

<Answer questions>


Environment
=======================

So we mentioned this earlier, but weather can pay an important part in your ability to track. The impact of weather is actually two-fold. It can be a boon, but it can also be a hindrance. Tracking after wind or rain has cleared the ground will reduce the amount of old spoor (tracks) that can confuse you, as long as the tracks you want to keep are not caught in the weather. Additional snow can cover tracks, rain can wash away tracks... but wet ground, especially in the case of sand will make for a much better tracking environment. afterwards.

Differentiating between old and new tracks is actually an important part of success in tracking. So what ways might we use to tell them apart?

<Wait for answers>

As spoor gets older, estimates to age can become more difficult, especially if there has not been recent inclement weather to speak of. This is the case even with seasoned trackers who might rely on their abilities to find food.

Weathering is a big factor, a track may not be completely erased by wind or rain, but it will become less defined afterwards, the more weathered the print, the older it is. Knowledge of recent weather conditions is a factor to take into consideration when estimating the age of a print. Once again, we come back to the importance of knowing your environment.

Another factor to consider are other tracks. Many animals use the same trails, these areas can have reduced vegetation due to frequent traffic and thus produce prints where there may otherwise not be any. Otherwise, sometimes tracks just cross paths with different creatures possessing a different goal at the time. Other tracks printed on top of our target print will also indicate that it is older. 

Knowledge of the footprints and habits of the creatures leaving other tracks may give further clues for increased accuracy. For example: if you're tracking a diurnal (day time) creature, and the track flattens out a track made by a nocturnal creature, then assuming both sets are fresh, you can deduce that the print you're following occurred that day, rather than the evening of the day before. This can give you a narrow window if tracking in the morning.

Other signs like splash marks at a watering hole, fresh droppings, or the presence of saliva on chewed vegetation may also help you determine the age of nearby tracks as water evaporates fairly quickly. I will talk more about other signs shortly.

If the days are hot and you suspect your quarry to have rested, perhaps by the presence of flattened vegetation, then consider also that they may have sought shade, and where the sun would have to be to create shade in that location could indicate the time your target rested there.


Other Spoor
===================

So what else besides footprints can we track?

<Wait for answers>

I've used the word spoor a few times, in its simplest sense, this means footprints, but it can also be used to mean any signs found on the ground and from disturbed vegetation. These may not simply be footprints but perhaps tool marks, has the quarry been digging at the ground, perhaps to unearth a root? This is also spoor. Flattened down grass, visible from a great distance due to the shininess of grass blades is also spoor. Sometimes all you'll see is a scuff mark that may be visible due to only the slightest change in color from the surrounding area. Stones dislodged from their recess, as well as stones that have been pressed into the ground, more so than their neighbors are also signs of movement and are considered spoor.


Other senses
==============

Scent is also important for several reasons. Firstly, if we're tracking something down wind of us, we can be detected by creatures with an acute sense of smell. For example: Moose hunted by some of the native Alaskans and Canadians will rest during the middle of the day. Before they rest, the moose will curve back on their direction of travel, whether they curve clockwise or anticlockwise is determined by whichever way is downwind. This means anyone following their tracks will be detected, before they follow the trail that curved back. 

Know your quarry: The Kutchin peoples work around this behavior by traveling in an arc downwind from the tracks, returning to the tracks periodically; picture the letter U, the top of the letter being at the tracks. They do this until they have apparently overshot, looping back until they pick up the reversed tracks, then making smaller arcs following the reversed tracks, still downwind until they find the moose. 

By knowing their quarry, they negate the moose's behavior of sitting down wind of its own tracks to discover anyone following them

The second importance of scent is that aside from just the air, those of you with an acute sense of smell may be able to pick up the scent of prey from its prior proximity to the environment. Maybe it rubbed itself on a tree? Maybe it scent marked to indicate territory? Maybe it just shed some scent on the path. It is for this reason that dogs can be a good companion to the tracker.


More Spoor
================

Another type of spoor are splash marks at a watering hole. Where water was sloshed onto the bank is indicative that a creature recently drank from there. The age of nearby tracks can be determined from that, since it would evaporate if it was too old.

Saliva can be useful, freshly bitten vegetation may still be damp. If you suspect the quarry is feeding, you may elect to go straight to the next good source of food for your prey, looking for signs that it has been there, or perhaps continues to be there. Empathy makes its triumphant return there.

Incidental signs, such as tufts of fur may belong to the target, but they may also have been blown there from elsewhere, so you may need to use intuition when using them.

Blood spoor, where a wounded creature leaves spots of blood in its wake may also be tracked. These spots may dot the ground or perhaps leave a smear on vegetation as the prey passes. On a nice enough surface, you may find that blood drops have a tail, which can help you indicate the direction of the creature.

Paths or trails themselves can also be used. At least if you're hunting for something to eat. The further out from a point of interest the trail is, the less defined it will be. As you follow the trail, it may become more defined, meaning more creatures have traversed it, this could indicate the presence of a watering hole or a source of food for the animals that use it. As well as a good place to set up a snare.

I think we've covered enough for the day, we could go into a lot more detail, like how we can tell a lot more about the activity of the creature by variations in its footprints. Or how the same creature can leave different shaped impressions in the ground depending on how soft the ground is. But hopefully I have given you enough information to RP tracking in a realistic way.

If you're tracking a player, IM them, discuss what signs they may have left behind. Did they walk in that exact spot? Did they traverse the grass and thus crumple it. Would they have perhaps left a tuft of fur caught on rough bark, or perhaps an abrasion on the trees. If you do this, you can prevent god-moding the target player. Leaving no trail at all is almost impossible. Remember though that your ability to track will probably start off weakly at L1.
